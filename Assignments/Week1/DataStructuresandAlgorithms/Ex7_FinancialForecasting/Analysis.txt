futureValueRecursive(double principal, double rate, int years)

    Time Complexity: O(n)
    → Makes one recursive call per year (n = years).

    Space Complexity: O(n)
    → Due to the recursion call stack, it uses one stack frame per call.

 futureValueIterative(double principal, double rate, int years)

    Time Complexity: O(n)
    → Executes a loop n times, once per year.

    Space Complexity: O(1)
    → Uses only a fixed amount of space regardless of n.
