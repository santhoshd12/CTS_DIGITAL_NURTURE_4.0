# 💰 Financial Forecasting Tool

## 📌 Overview

This Java application calculates the **future value of an investment** using two approaches:
- ✅ Recursive calculation
- ✅ Iterative calculation

The tool uses the standard compound interest formula:

Future Value = P * (1 + r)^n

Where:
- `P` is the initial principal (investment)
- `r` is the annual growth rate
- `n` is the number of years
